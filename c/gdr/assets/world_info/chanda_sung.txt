Surrounded by treacherous seas, Chanda Sung is made up of a series of allied provinces scattered across the great archipelago of the Ancient Lands.
Because Chanda Sung\'s culture has long been shaped by the pursuit of balance,
the line between the material and spiritual realms is more porous here, especially in the forests and mountains.

Though the enchantments of these lands are fickle and the creatures are dangerous and fey, Sungi have thrived there for centuries.
The warrior monasteries, provincial militias, and Chanda Sung's own land had been protection enough.

Everything changed twelve years ago, when Noxus attacked the Oldlands.
The endless troops of the empire devastated Chanda Sung and were only defeated after many years... and at great cost.

Now Chanda Sung lives in an uneasy peace. Different reactions to the war have divided the region.
Some groups, such as the Shojin monks of Kinkou, would like to return to an isolationist pacifism and rural traditions.
Other more radical factions, such as the Navori Brotherhood and the Order of the Shadow, are calling for a militarization of land magic,
to create a single united nation capable of taking revenge against Thato Kehinde.

Chanda Sung's fate is in a delicate balance that hardly anyone dares to touch, but which everyone perceives as precarious.
